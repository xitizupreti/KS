              Hey its not that I just got this question popped up out of no
              where and I am now answering. I searched for this question so that
              I can write this answer. I am writing this secret for that
              somebody whom I loved the most and was not able to tell him. I
              feel that if he read this and contact me, I will be on cloud 9. If
              he read this story and can able to co-relate this story he will
              for sure revert me. So the story goes like this..
            </span>

          <p>
            <span>
              Back in 1995, This was a time when my life changed for ever, ever
              means ever .... ever
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              I became a good, a perfect, a conclassNameent person in my life.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Why??? How???</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Bcoz I met this guy let's call him S, I wish I could right the
              full name. But I hope that will able to do so one day, for good
              reason
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              So how??? The story goes this way. When I was in my 5th std we had
              2 classes of std 5 th A and 5th B merged together and here I met
              S. The story seems like a story of a movie. So teacher made S and
              me sit on same bench. My friend told me that this guy S is a
              scholar. I had heard about him many a time from my friend before
              also. I was least interested and when she pointed out and showed
              me this guy, I even didn't bother to have a look at him, I just
              ignored him.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              I didn't like at all that teacher made me sit with him, so I was
              very angry. I decided to push his bag down occasionally from bench
              as a mark of revenge...
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But slowly he came to know that. He came to know that I am doing
              this intentionally..
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              He didn't say anything to me, he went to teacher and told her
              about my mischief.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Teacher Scolded me and told me that you shouldn't be doing this
              and told him to sit behind me.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Now the real story begins.. As he was brilliant student he use to
              answer all the questions raised by any teacher of any subject, all
              teachers were impressed by this Mr S. I became very jealous of
              him. This made me think that if he can answer in class why can't
              I. I was a very introvert person way back then, but I worked on
              myself. I worked really hard, just to let him down I use to keep
              all my work ready before hand. I use to study all my lessons
              before teacher teaches them in class. Also I started keeping all
              the answers of the questions ready before hand so that I can
              answer them before he does. I started becoming more n more active
              n alert in the class. There was kind of race between me n S that
              who will answer first. We both use to answer very promptly. Our
              teacher was so impressed with S n me that she made both of us
              class monitor.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Now I was girls monitor n he was boys monitor.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Now here our love story begins.. we both started sharing time with
              each other. We use to make all class sit quietly and we both use
              to talk. The whole class will sit quietly in our terror and would
              watch both of us chitchatting.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              This was a daily routine. He fall for me first I guess. How I came
              to know????
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>He use to call my name every now n then.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              He use to find any n every alternative chance to talk to me. It
              went to such an extreme that one fine day our teacher made both of
              us stand n scolded us saying that she is receiving lot of
              complaints about us stating that we both are talking a lot üòÇüòÖüòÉ
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              And then the most funny part came, this I will not forget my whole
              life. After scolding us, teacher ask both of us to shift our
              benches apart. (Remember He was sitting right behind me after he
              had made that complaint about me) so as he was sitting behind me
              we use to talk a lot, so teacher asked both of us to shift our
              benches apart and told "KEEP GAP BETWEEN BOTH OF YOUR BENCHES"
              this sentence made a strike in my mind for the first time that yes
              there is some smoke, and saw the fire right after the period/class
              was over. As soon as the class was over n our dear class teacher
              left the class, in no time he again making a huge sound of bench
              shifted his bench towards my bench and proved that yes there is a
              üî• fire.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              I know most of you will think or say that - is it a right time to
              be in LOVE????. No!!!! Some people will tag it ‚ÄúAn immature
              affair‚Äù some will say ‚Äú hormones change‚Äù etc etc, but believe me
              it was not the case, we were truly madly in love with each other
              with all the purest feelings n form. But we never showed our
              feelings to each other. May be we believed in the ‚Äúlucknowy
              tehzib‚Äù pehele aap- pehele aap‚Äù.üòÇüòÇ And didn't say anything to
              each other.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              So coming back to my secret story. This all went for the entire
              year of my 5th std. We both cleared and promoted to 6th std. Now
              here more funny thing happened, this time our new class teacher
              didn't make us sit on the same bench nor behind, nor side by side,
              in fact not at all near by. There were four rows of benches in
              each class and one row consists of about 8 to 9 branches 1 behind
              another something like this
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Now he was sitting in 1 side of the row and I was sitting all the
              way to some another corner in a row far away from his. I was quite
              disappointed and I guess so was he. But he proved that he was not
              only brilliant in studies but is truly a smart one in other
              matters too. There was one rule that teacher had made was that
              every week like on every Monday we all have to shift one row
              behind so that every one gets a chance to sit on the first bench
              and every one gets a chance to sit on last bench too. Now what he
              did was, after few days of our class when teacher forgot that who
              is sitting where, he slowly managed to make friendship with a guy
              who was sitting in my row(but on the last bench). Mr. S some how
              convinced his friend, that they both will sit on the last bench
              only and will not move on to the first bench and he managed to
              tell the second last bench people to keep on moving to the first
              bench. I don't know how he managed but every thing happened as per
              his planning and we all kept on moving one bench behind every new
              week. Now the time came when finally I was on the second last
              bench and he was right behind me on the last bench. We spent a
              great week together chitchatting. We really had a great time, you
              know when someone so near n dear to you is with you and without
              confessing your love to each other only giving hints of it is real
              fun thing to do in your teen age. Now the weekend arrived, it was
              Saturday the last day of the week ofcourse, now from coming Monday
              I have to go to first bench as everyone was doing this since quite
              a long. Instead of shifting from second last bench to last bench,
              Every one was moving to first bench from second last bench
              directly as this Mr S and his friend from long time was sitting on
              the same last bench. So on Monday morning when with a sad mood I
              entered in the class the first thing I saw was ‚Ä¶,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ hisss bag,
              I still remember the colour of his bag that dark bottle green
              color bag of his.

            <div></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            <span>
              I was like,ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçüòçüòç my heart was filled with joy, I felt so
              special, I said to myself yess!!! yess!!! yess !!! He loves me. He
              was not there in the class I saw Mr. S and his friend's bags on
              the first bench, I quickly went to the last bench and placed my
              bag there. I knew this one week he will be sitting on first bench
              and I have to sit way back on the last bench, but only for one
              week then from next week I will be on the first bench and he will
              follow me for the entire month almost‚Ä¶ too smart naaüòéüòéüòéüòé‚úåÔ∏è.
              But you know what, he didn't even waited for a week aswell, as I
              said he was a brilliant boy of class so again he was the class
              monitor. He use to come to my bench every now and then some time
              use to talk to me and some time use to talk to the students
              sitting nearby me and use to give me his cute dimpled filled smile
              without saying anything to me, I can die for that. I also use to
              pass on a smile in return. This fun loving stuff continued for
              quit a long time. This charm lasted for quite a while, But one day
              it hot ruined. Howw????
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>I am here to tell you that aswell.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Few dum n stupid girls of our class who can not manage their
              monthly problem secretly went to our teacher and requested that as
              it's a poberty period for girls, kindly make all girls sit on one
              side and boys on other side. F**k off REALLY. Teacher acknowledged
              their request and hence we got separated.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But love is love it do fine new interesting ways to deal with. Now
              some new fun stuff started. He use to look at me every now n then
              from one corner of class, sometimes I use to look at him and at
              the very same time he also use to look at me, that very moment I
              use to feel like I missed on my one heart beat or sometimes I use
              to feel like my heart is running like a spead of Rajdhani Express.
              There were hell lot of times when we both use to look at each
              other and without saying anything we use to look down blushing
              away. My friends started discussing among themselves that why this
              Mr. S is looking towards them. Silly girls they were not able to
              make out at whom he is looking at. As I mentioned earlier he was a
              bright student, he had my girls following aswell. so all girls
              sitting nearby me use to think that may be this S is looking at
              them. Silly girls ü§™ü§™. Really love was in the air‚Ä¶ But now what's
              next. I wanted him to come n share his feelings to me, but he
              never showed that guts. Then slowly I started to wonder, whether
              he really loves me or it's just an illusion for me. An infinite
              dream of mine who is in her teen age. Day by day I became more and
              more insecure and in this feeling of insecurity I made a very
              wrong decision. one super bad day I found out that if I am talking
              to any other guy of the class, which usually I never use to do,
              made him feel very in secured. I noticed this and thought that why
              not to make him jealous by talking to some other guy so that he
              will feel insecure n will approach me. Soo so teen age mentality.
              So here I was I decided to talk to this simple boy let's name him
              B. So this Mr B was a good dancer and there was a school annual
              day function going to happened so this B was dancing on one of the
              salman khan song, every one was cheering him while he was
              practicing, so I went there and started cheering him, I started
              shouting clapping etc etc. I slowly observed the reaction of My Mr
              S he was so so so on üî•üî•üí•üí•‚ö°‚ö° fire. I really really enjoyed
              it. But honestly it was very wrong thing that I was doing. Never
              ever make that one person insecure who loves you a lot -seriously‚Ä¶
              So I started to talk to this guy B, this guy B was genuine guy,
              poor fellow use to talk to me just as a friend. But my Mr S took
              exactly the same feelings (jealousy) which I wanted to throw on
              him.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              one fine day when in our school recess (break) time, My Mr. S was
              playing cricket and My friends and I was standing near by just
              chilling in the break time. Suddenly I saw Mr. B also Standing
              nearby. He was listening some song in his walkman as I earlier
              mentioned that he was practicing for the annual function. I
              insisted my friends to go to him( Mr. B) and ask him which song he
              is listening to. for obvious reason to put some fire on my Mr. S.
              So here I went along with my friends and ask Mr. B which song are
              you listening to, I also ask him to share me with one side
              earphone wire, he did so. so now the scenario from far away where
              my Mr. S was playing cricket was looking like Mr. B and I are
              listening or rather enjoy to the same song. from one corner of my
              eye I checked on my Mr. S and this time he was not on fire but on
              Volcano. He was so so dam jealous that he stopped playing cricket
              and started checking us out. this feeling of his jealousy made me
              so happy. I told to my self ‚ÄúMr. S, I will make sure that you will
              come to me on your knees.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But you know what he is more smart. As I mentioned he is the class
              topper and all the girls in the class were ready or rather die to
              talk to him. It was hell easy for him to make me jealous. Now what
              he did was he some how manage to have an affair with some other
              girl of our class lets name her E. Mr. S spread rumors that he and
              Ms. E is having an affair and now I was feeling like I am sitting
              on the top of Amazon forest which has lighted with a huge never
              ending fire. I was very disappointed by this, I cried at night
              like hell. I was very very unhappy. Probably being unhappy is a
              very small word to describe my feeling. Now I came to know how he
              must have felt when I did the same thing with him.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              I decided to rectify on my mistake, what I did was on the day of
              rakhi I went to Mr. B and I tied rakhi to Mr. B and as I told you
              that( Mr. B) he was a very simple guy, He tied rakhi from me and I
              make sure that all this rakhi tying celebration happen in front of
              Mr. S so that he can rest assure that there is nothing else
              between me and Mr. B. My Mr. S saw all this celebration happening,
              I felt that he was very happy looking all this thing and after few
              days I got the news from some of my friends that my Mr. S and Ms.
              E got broke up.

              Ms. E was definitely heart by my Mr. S and you must be thinking
              that how this Mr. B must have got hurt as he we were just good
              friends. But the actual thing was that when my Mr. S first came to
              know about Mr. B and Me. He tortured Mr. B a lot and make sure
              that Mr. B is being boycotted and that most of the boys who were
              Mr. S friends doesn‚Äôt talks with him. poor mr. B he was not
              knowing why all this was happening with him.

              when we finished our 8th std along with this our love life
              roller-coaster ride, we were promoted to 9th std. when the summer
              vacations are over, usually most of the students are unhappy but I
              was the only one sample who was very happy as now my new session
              of 9th std was going to start and I will be meeting my Mr. S. The
              first day of 9th Std, I went to the school as soon as I entered
              the school premises my eyes started searching for him, I couldn't
              see him there I thought he must be in class room. I went to our
              new class and search for him, but I couldn't see him, I search for
              his this green color bag but couldn‚Äôt find it. I told to my self ‚Äú
              chill how long he is going to bring the same green bag, he must
              have change the bag‚Äù explaining this to my self I went to assembly
              hall to search him. soon when I reached the hall one of my friend
              told me that Mr, S have left the school and god knows for what dam
              reason his parents decided the change his school. I want to sit at
              one place and want to cry. Cry like hell but meantime assembly
              started I was reciting the prayer and was asking with my teary
              eyes where I went wrong why all this happened to me. I wanted to
              end my life and what not. some how I console myself and only god
              knows how my that day and rest all days went in the school. I kind
              of stop studying. I was looking so pail that my relatives and
              people around me started asking my parents whats wrong with her.
              My parents asked me many times whats wrong with me. I stopped
              eating, going out celebrating any festivals. this all went for
              quite a long time. one day in school during the break time I was
              hanging around in the school campus and what I saw ‚Äúoh my god
              there was he standing in our school campus. he pretended as if he
              is waiting for few of his friends and he had come to meet them. He
              stood there for quite a long time all alone. I could feel the
              vibes that he was waiting for me to come to him and talk to him.
              but I just kept looking at him from a distant place. latter our
              break time was over and I had to return to my class and he also
              went away.

              After that, time passed and I use to get some or other chance to
              see him, sometime in his school bus which use to pass from our
              school main road daily, sometime use to get some of his
              information through our common friends etc. likewise days and
              years passed and I remember last time when I saw him was when we
              were in 10th std. after that I never ever saw him. I had this very
              strong feeling that one day he will come and will propose me but
              that day never came. we moved on in our life. Our common friends
              lose contact and I never came to know about his whereabouts. I
              thought one fine day he will come to me but I guess I was not able
              to give him same level of confidence that how much I love him and
              so may be he thought that I don‚Äôt love him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

              well These are all my guesses I never know that weather he loved
              me or not. Was he having a real kind of love with this Ms. E or he
              was just making me jealous. I never came to know that weather he
              was looking at me most of the time in the class or it was just a
              co-incident. I don‚Äôt rally know that this long story between him
              and me was real or just my imagination. Only he can tell that.

              FAST FORWARD - Now its 2020 and years have passed down, slowly I
              kind of moved on and got busy with my other career ambitions. I
              got married and settled with a decent guy who loves me a lot.
              Although mine was an arrange marriage, as I was not able to love
              anyone after him. I cannot say that I don‚Äôt love my husband, yes I
              do but that feelings for him was priceless. No matter where ever I
              go, whatever I do, I feel incomplete, sometimes I still feel that
              I am standing in that school assembly with all those tears in my
              eyes and time have just stopped there only. I have a 8 yr old son.
              I have a loving family, but I never feel happy. I guess I can not
              forget him. And you know what I came to know that he is married
              now, a big cloud have busted on me. Although I am married but I am
              not able to bear the pain of him getting married. still want to
              cry a lot.

              I feel one day he will read this post and will get back to me. And
              the super strange thing is he in on Quora. I have his mobile no.
              with me I know his where about but now I don‚Äôt have guts to talk
              to him like after all this years, how can I talk to him. I wish he
              stay happy with his family and my intentions are no way to get him
              in my life, or break his family or to distract him. Even I can not
              do that with my family, what is my husband and my son‚Äô s fault in
              all this. I have compromise that in my next birth I will for sure
              meet him and will live happily ever after. But in my next birth.
              what else tats it.
