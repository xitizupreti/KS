        From songs and poems to novels and movies, romantic love is one of the
        most enduring subjects for artworks through the ages. But what about the
        science? Historical, cultural and even evolutionary evidence suggests
        love existed during ancient times and across many parts of the world.
        Romantic love has been found to exist in 147 of 166 cultures looked at
        in one study. The complexity of love has much to do with how people
        experience it differently and how it can change over time.

        Love is an emotion that keeps people bonded and committed to one
        another. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, love evolved to
        keep the parents of children together long enough for them to survive
        and reach sexual maturity.
        <br />
        The period of childhood is much longer for humans than other species. As
        offspring rely on adults for many years to survive and to develop the
        skills and abilities needed for successful living, love is especially
        important for humans. Without love, itâ€™s difficult to see how the human
        species could have evolved.
